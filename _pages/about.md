Hi! I am a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA. My major is Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. Before joining grad school, I was a full-time software developer at Adobe Systems, India for three years. I iteratively document my research and professional work here.

I am currently interning at Google, Mountain View, California, for the summer of 2022. My interests lie in applied machine learning, natural language processing, and product development. Happy to chat about common interests, work collaborations, or questions about my work! Can be reached at vvashishth3 at gatech dot edu.
