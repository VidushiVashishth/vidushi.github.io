Hi! I am an engineer at Google Cloud in Seattle. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Masters in Computer Science and a specialization in Machine Learning. Before joining grad school, I was a full-time software developer at Adobe Systems, India. I iteratively document my research and professional work here.

At Georgia Tech I worked in Prof. Alexey Tumanov's Systems for AI [Lab](https://gatech-sysml.github.io/members/vidushi-vashishta.html) to optimize system's problems in hosting large models in production. I also worked in Prof. Mark Riedl's EI & HCAI [Lab](https://eilab.gatech.edu/mark-riedl.html) to develop co-creative agents for story telling. My interests lie in system's problems in Machine Learning, natural language processing, and efficient backend system development. Happy to chat about common interests, work collaborations, or questions about my work! Can be reached at vvashishth3 at gatech dot edu.
